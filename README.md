# Cryptography
This repository is meant to dive deep into elegant cryptosystems. We will outline each project and system we build and explain our implementation and design choices in effort to guide the next crypto-enthusiasts into this vast base of knowledge.

**Disclaimer**: Never use these or your own implementations of cryptographic schemes/systems.
These implementations are purely for educational purposes.
In each project directory, there will be a README describing the flaws and potential areas of attack of the implementations.
